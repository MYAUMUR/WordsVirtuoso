# WordsVirtuoso
Words Virtuoso is a console-based word guessing game that challenges players to guess a secret five-letter word by inputting five-letter words into the game's input. The program validates the input words against certain rules and shows whether the input words' letters coincide with the secret word letters. The game is designed to be entertaining and addictive while also providing a learning experience for working with strings, files, and collections.

### Learning Outcomes
Words Virtuoso provides a hands-on experience with several essential tools for creating good-looking and engaging programs, including:

* Working with strings, files, and collections
* Using colors in console applications
* Implementing rules for validating strings
* Reading and parsing files
* Defining game toughness with word lists
### How to Play
To start the game, simply run the Main.kt file in a Kotlin interpreter. The program will prompt the player to input a five-letter word. The player must input a valid five-letter word that follows the program's validation rules. The program will then show whether the input word's letters coincide with the secret word letters.

The player can continue to input words until they guess the secret word correctly. The program will track the time it takes for the player to guess the word and show the time at the end of the game.

### Implementation Details
The game's word list is stored in a text file, which the program reads and parses to ensure that all words follow the validation rules. The program also includes a strategy for defining the game's toughness with the candidate words list.

To increase user-friendliness, the program uses colors in the console output.
